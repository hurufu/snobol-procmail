Here you can find a procmail (or slocal) replacement. It take an email as its
standard input and classifies it to a folder and outputs it's name to standard
output. It is supposed to run by MRA program like mpop or fetchmail.

Sample mpop configuration to work in tandem with MH looks like:

    delivery mda "rcvstore $(spitbol $THIS_DIR/*.spt)"

It's a toy project, an attempt to learn a little bit of SNOBOL4 by doing
something remotely useful.
